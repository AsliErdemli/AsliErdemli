- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AsliErdemli
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an affective neuroscience PhD Student at the University of Geneva.
- I conduct neuroimaging research on epistemic emotions: curiosity, interest & boredom. My work aims to determine how they are represented in the healthy adult brain, how they interact with our dopaminergic reward circuit & how they are triggered.
- I use R and tidyverse to work on behavioral data. I use Python & Nilearn for fMRI data. I use Python & mne for EEG data. I use Matlab and Psychtoolbox for experiment displays.
