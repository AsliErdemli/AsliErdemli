**'PhD Candidate in Affective Neuroscience and Freelance Data Scientist'**

I am a Neuroscience PhD Candidate at the University of Geneva. I do fMRI research on epistemic emotions (i.e. curiosity, interest, boredom, confusion) and use data science to analyze neuroimaging, physiological and behavioral data. I love making sense of data and transforming a csv file of numbers into clear insights. If I was a triangle I would be something like: scientific theory  - stats/coding - confident presentation.
Occasionally, I use my data skills on non-academic project as a freelance data scientist.

### Languages and tools
- Python 3 (nilearn, numpy, panda, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, mne  )

- MATLAB (SPM & PsychToolbox)
- Latex with Overleaf
- environment management with Anaconda or miniconda 
- Git and Github 
- Gorilla and AWS
- bash 

#
### What I do
- Scientific writing on emotion theory, epistemic emotions and dopaminergic reward circuit
- Hypothesis testing
- Data collection (fMRI, physiological and behavioral)
- Experiment design with fMRI and olfactometer
- Data analysis (General Linear Models (GLM), Machine Learning)
- Insight reporting
- Public speaking

### My Academic Research
I conduct neuroimaging (fMRI) research on epistemic emotions: curiosity, interest & boredom. My work aims to determine how they are represented in the healthy adult brain, how they interact with our dopaminergic reward circuit & how they are triggered. I previously worked on the link between food consumption and boredom. You can find all of my academic work here: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4970-4028. 
- I use R and tidyverse to work on behavioral data. 
- I use Python & Nilearn for fMRI data. 
- I use Python & mne for EEG data. 
- I use Matlab and Psychtoolbox for experiment displays.
