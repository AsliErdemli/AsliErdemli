# Asli Erdemli

**'PhD Student in Affective Neuroscience and Freelance Data Scientist'**

I am a Neuroscience PhD Student at the University of Geneva. I do fMRI research on epistemic emotions (i.e. curiosity, interest, boredom, confusion) and use data science to analyze neuroimaging, physiological and behavioral data. I love making sense of data and transforming a csv file of numbers into clear insights. If I was a triangle I would be something like: scientific theory  - stats/coding - confident presentation.
Occasionally, I use my data skills on non-academic project as a freelance data scientist. 

## Languages and tools
Python 
R and R studio
MATLAB
Latex with Overleaf



## My Academic Research
I conduct neuroimaging research on epistemic emotions: curiosity, interest & boredom. My work aims to determine how they are represented in the healthy adult brain, how they interact with our dopaminergic reward circuit & how they are triggered.
- I use R and tidyverse to work on behavioral data. I use Python & Nilearn for fMRI data. I use Python & mne for EEG data. I use Matlab and Psychtoolbox for experiment displays.
